# Deployment Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done Today

### 1. Fixed Vercel Build Issues
**Problem**: Vercel was trying to build from root directory, but Vite is in `frontend/` subdirectory.

**Solution**: 
- Created `vercel.json` configuration file
- Updated root `package.json` with build script
- Configured Vercel to build from `frontend/` directory

### 2. Fixed API URL Configuration
**Problem**: Frontend was making API calls to itself (Vercel) instead of the backend (Railway).

**Solution**:
- Created central configuration file: `frontend/src/lib/config.js`
- Updated all API calls to use centralized `API_BASE_URL`
- Configured environment variables properly

### 3. Set Up Railway Backend
**Problem**: Render free tier doesn't support FFmpeg without Docker.

**Solution**:
- Migrated to Railway (has FFmpeg built-in)
- Configured Railway with proper build and start commands
- Set up CORS origins to allow Vercel frontend

### 4. Added Backend Health Check
**Problem**: Railway health checks were failing because no root endpoint existed.

**Solution**:
- Added `GET /` endpoint to `backend/app/main.py`
- Returns JSON status for health monitoring

### 5. Centralized Configuration
**Problem**: API base URL was duplicated in multiple files.

**Solution**:
- Created `frontend/src/lib/config.js` as single source of truth
- Updated all files to import from central config:
  - `frontend/src/lib/api.js`
  - `frontend/src/lib/templateConfigs.js`
  - `frontend/src/pages/create/Create.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useVideoTrim.js`

### 6. Cleaned Up Unnecessary Files
**Removed**:
- `backend/apt-packages.txt` (was for Render)
- `render.yaml` (was for Render)
- `backend/build.sh` (was for Render)

### 7. Created Comprehensive Documentation
**New Files**:
- `DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG.md` - Complete deployment guide
- Updated `README.md` with deployment section
- This summary file

## üìã Current Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Vercel (Frontend)
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://video-builder-production.up.railway.app/api
```
- Set in: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Applied to: Production, Preview, Development

#### Railway (Backend)
```
CORS_ORIGINS = http://localhost:5173,https://video-builder-nu.vercel.app
```
- Set in: Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab
- Allows requests from local development and production frontend

### Deployment URLs

**Production**:
- Frontend: https://video-builder-nu.vercel.app/
- Backend: https://video-builder-production.up.railway.app/
- API Docs: https://video-builder-production.up.railway.app/api/docs

**Local Development**:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/docs

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Production Flow
1. User visits Vercel frontend
2. Frontend loads with `VITE_API_BASE_URL` pointing to Railway
3. All API calls go directly to Railway backend
4. Railway processes requests using FFmpeg
5. Responses sent back to frontend

### Development Flow
1. Run `npm run dev` from root
2. Frontend runs on `localhost:5173`
3. Backend runs on `localhost:8000`
4. Vite proxy routes `/api/*` to `localhost:8000`
5. No environment variables needed locally

            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py                # Backend settings
```

### Important Notes
- **Single Source of Truth**: All API URLs come from `frontend/src/lib/config.js`
- **Automatic Deployments**: Both Vercel and Railway auto-deploy on git push
- **Environment Detection**: Config automatically switches between dev and prod
- **No Hardcoded URLs**: All URLs use configuration variables

## üöÄ Next Steps for You

### To Push These Changes:
```bash
git push origin main
```

This will trigger:
- ‚úÖ Vercel automatic deployment
- ‚úÖ Railway automatic deployment

### To Test After Deployment:
1. Visit https://video-builder-nu.vercel.app/
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
3. Should see: `API Configuration: { baseUrl: "https://video-builder-production.up.railway.app/api", ... }`
4. Try creating a video
5. Check Network tab - requests should go to Railway

### If Something Goes Wrong:

**Frontend Issues**:
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set
- Redeploy if you just added environment variables

**Backend Issues**:
- Check Railway logs
- Verify `CORS_ORIGINS` includes your Vercel URL
- Check that service is "Live" in Railway dashboard

**API Call Issues**:
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- Check if requests go to Railway or Vercel
- If going to Vercel, environment variable isn't applied

3. **Auto-Deployments**: Push to GitHub = automatic deploys
4. **FFmpeg Support**: Railway has FFmpeg built-in
5. **Clean Codebase**: Removed unnecessary files
6. **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive docs for future reference
7. **Local Development**: Works seamlessly without config changes

## üéâ Result
